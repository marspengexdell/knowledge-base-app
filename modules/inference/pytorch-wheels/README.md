# PyTorch Wheels

This directory should contain the `torch`, `torchvision` and `torchaudio` wheel files matching CUDA 12.1 used by the inference Docker image. These files are not included in the repository.

Download the appropriate wheels from [https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121) on a machine with internet access and place them in this folder before building the Docker image.
